The 1952 article by Hodgkin and Huxley titled "A quantitative description of membrane current and its application to conduction and excitation in nerve" introduced the Hodgkin-Huxley model, a mathematical representation of how nerve impulses travel along the axon of a neuron. The model proposed that voltage-dependent ion channels in the cell membrane allow the flow of specific ions in and out of the cell, creating an electrical signal that is transmitted along the axon. This report focuses on recreating some of the figures generated in the paper using NEURON's graphical interface and python.
