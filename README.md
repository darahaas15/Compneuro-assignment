The 1952 Journal of Physiology article by Alan Lloyd Hodgkin and Andrew Fielding Huxley titled "A quantitative description of membrane current and its application to conduction and excitation in nerve" made a significant contribution to the discipline of neuroscience. The Hodgkin-Huxley model, a mathematical representation of how nerve impulses travel along the axon of a neuron, is developed in this publication.

Before the Hodgkin-Huxley model was created, it was unclear how action potentials were produced and transmitted along nerve fibres. Hodgkin and Huxley sought to explain this process by developing a mathematical model that incorporated ion channels, which they believed were responsible for the flow of ions across the cell membrane and the generation of action potentials.

The Hodgkin-Huxley model proposed that the cell membrane contains voltage-dependent ion channels, which allow the flow of specific ions in and out of the cell in response to changes in membrane potential. These ion channels open and close in response to changes in the membrane potential, creating an electrical signal that is transmitted along the axon of the neuron. 

Numerous figures were generated in the paper using the equations formulated by Hodgkin and Huxley. This report focuses on recreating some of these figures by using NEURONâ€™s graphical interface and some by using python.
