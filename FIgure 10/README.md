The plot shows a sigmoidal curve, with h_inf increasing steeply as the membrane potential becomes more positive, and approaching a plateau value of 1 as V becomes very positive. Conversely, h_inf decreases steeply as the membrane potential becomes more negative, and approaches a plateau value of 0 as V becomes very negative. The curve passes through the midpoint at the voltage V_h, which is where the probability of the inactivation gate being closed is 0.5.

This graph is useful for visualizing the voltage dependence of the inactivation gate of an ion channel. It can help researchers to understand how the probability of the inactivation gate being closed changes with membrane potential, and how the voltage sensitivity of the inactivation gate affects its behavior. This information can be used to build models of ion channel function and to investigate the role of ion channels in physiological processes.
