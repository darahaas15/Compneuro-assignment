# Figure 9

The figure shown consists of two plots, each representing the rate constants of the inactivation and activation gates of a hypothetical ion channel, respectively, as functions of the membrane potential V. The smooth curves in the plot were calculated using the equations given in the paper or based on the Hodgkin-Huxley model.

The graph allows for a comparison between the experimental values of the rate constants and the predicted values based on the mathematical equations. Such a comparison can help validate the mathematical model and provide insight into the underlying mechanisms of ion channel function.
